===================

=====

`dtmapi` is a Python package developed by `Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) <https://dtm.iom.int/>`_. This package is designed to serve the humanitarian community, academia, media, government, and non-governmental organizations by providing access to data collected by DTM.

- **Country Level (Admin 0)**
- **First-level Administrative Divisions (Admin 1)**
- **Second-level Administrative Divisions (Admin2)**

The data available through `dtmapi` can help organizations and individuals better understand and respond to internal displacement situations globally.
